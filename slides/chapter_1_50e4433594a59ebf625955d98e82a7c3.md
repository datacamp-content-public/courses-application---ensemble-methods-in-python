Maybe you have seen contest shows, like "Who wants to be a Millionaire". When a contestant doesn't know the right answer or is not sure about it, there is a "life-line" option to poll the audience. Usually, the participant chooses the most voted answer, hoping it is the correct one.
In fact, according to stats from TV studios, the audience predicts the correct answer more than ninety percent of the time! How is that possible?
Well, this is thanks to the concept known as _Wisdom of the Crowd_. It refers to the collective intelligence or opinion based on a group of individuals instead of a single expert. The idea is the aggregated opinion of the crowd can be as good as, and usually superior, to the answer of any individual, even that of an expert. This is a very useful technique applied to problem solving, decision making, innovation, and prediction; the last one, being our interest.
