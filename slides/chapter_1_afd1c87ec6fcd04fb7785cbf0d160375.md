Welcome to the course of Ensemble Methods in Python!
My name is Román de las Heras and I'll be guiding you through this course. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at SAP & Agile Solutions, mainly building Machine Learning Models.
Our first lesson is an intuitive introduction to Ensemble Methods.

## Choosing the best model

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"

```

`@part1`
**Which model is the best?**

_Chosen "best" model: Decision Tree_ {{2}}


`@script`
When you're building a model, you want to choose the one that performs the best according to some evaluation metric. Maybe you have already tried some models and then you compare them based on its score.
For instance, consider this example. Here we trained a Decision Tree, a Logistic Regression, and a K-Nearest Neighbors model. 
If we choose the model based on its accuracy, then Decision Tree would be the best choice, right?
The problem of doing this is that we are discarding the other models, which were able to learn different patterns and have additional useful properties.
What can we do about it?

- **Categorical:** Mode {{3}}
- **Numerical:**   Mean {{4}}


`@script`
Well, let's see an analogous case. When you apply a survey, you don't take only the best answers. Actually, you consider a combined response of all the participants. For the categorical variables, the mode is a good representation. And for the numerical variablep
